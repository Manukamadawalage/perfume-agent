# Fragrance Safety Rules

## Sensitivity Factor
- **Sensitive Skin**: Reduce concentrations of oils like **citrus** (Lemon, Bergamot) and **spicy** oils (Clove, Cinnamon).
- **Photo-sensitivity**: For oils that cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight, such as citrus oils.
- **Cap Reduction**: For sensitive skin, ensure that no oil exceeds **70%** of its normal maximum concentration.

## Cap Policies
- **Max Concentration**: Each essential oil has a **max percentage** (see oils.json). If the oil is used beyond its max concentration, it should be adjusted.
- **Accords Limitations**: Some accords are inherently stronger than others, so limit the number of oils in the same accord.
